# UN/CEFACT JSON Schema NDR Technical Specification and OpenAPI NDR Technical Specification
The aim of this project is to expose the rich UN/CEFACT semantics so it can be used in APIs using precise, machine readable semantics. The intended audience of the UN/CEFACT vocab includes other UN/CEFACT projects as well as anyone else in the world expressing trade and transport data. 

The JSON Schema NDR TS defines a standardised method to generate the UN/CEFACT data structures of the reference data models and the manifold message structures as standardised JSON schema files. This repository serves as a test platform during the project phase. Subsequently, the final location for the publication of the UN/CEFACT standards will be defined. The generated JSON schema files will serve as standardised input for the JSON-LD project from the end of this project. In this way, conformity between these two formats will be ensured. 

The OpenAPI NDR TS defines the rules for creating an API specification that conforms to the UN/CEFACT rules. The spec-openAPI repository publishes sample specifications and a template for a compliant OpenAPI specification.

UN/CEFACT vocab builds upon the work done on the RDM2API work stream between 2018 and 2021.
